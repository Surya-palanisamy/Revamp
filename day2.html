      A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions
      of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people,
      have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came
      into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on
      them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German
      inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely
      available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to
      the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford
      Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced
      animal-drawn carriages and carts. In Europe and other parts of the world,
      demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The
      car is considered an essential part of the developed economy. Cars have
      controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights.
      Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to
      vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include
      rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car
      entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an
      internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.
      Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became
      commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy
      than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition from fossil
      fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change
      mitigation scenarios,[7] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable
      solutions for climate change.[8]
